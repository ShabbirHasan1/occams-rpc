//! # occams-rpc-stream
//!
//! This crate provides a low-level streaming interface for `occams-rpc`.
//! It is used for stream processing and is part of the modular design of `occams-rpc`.
//!
//! If you are looking for a high-level remote API call interface, use [`occams-rpc`](https://docs.rs/occams-rpc) instead.
//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! `occams-rpc` is designed to be modular and pluggable. It is a collection of crates that provide different functionalities:
//!
//! - [`occams-rpc-core`](https://docs.rs/occams-rpc-core): A core utils crate.
//! - [`occams-rpc-codec`](https://docs.rs/occams-rpc-codec): Provides codecs for serialization, such as `msgpack`.
//! - Runtimes:
//!   - [`occams-rpc-tokio`](https://docs.rs/occams-rpc-tokio): A runtime adapter for the `tokio` runtime.
//!   - [`occams-rpc-smol`](https://docs.rs/occams-rpc-smol): A runtime adapter for the `smol` runtime.
//! - Transports can be implemented with a raw socket, without the overhead of the HTTP protocol:
//!   - [`occams-rpc-tcp`](https://docs.rs/occams-rpc-tcp): A TCP transport implementation.
//!
//! ## The Design
//!
//! Our implementation is designed to optimize throughput and lower
//! CPU consumption for high-performance services.
//!
//! Each connection is a full-duplex, multiplexed stream.
//! There's a `seq` ID assigned to a packet to track
//! a request and response. The timeout of a packet is checked in batches every second.
//! We utilize the [crossfire](https://docs.rs/crossfire) channel for parallelizing the work with
//! coroutines.
//!
//! With an [ClientStream](crate::client_stream::ClientStream), the user sends packets in sequence,
//! with a throttler controlling the IO depth of in-flight packets.
//! An internal timer then registers the request through a channel, and when the response
//! is received, it can optionally notify the user through a user-defined channel or another mechanism.
//!
//! In an [RpcServer](crate::server_impl::RpcServer), for each connection, there is one coroutine to read requests and one
//! coroutine to write responses. Requests can be dispatched with a user-defined
//! [ReqDispatch](crate::server::ReqDispatch) trait implementation.
//!
//! Responses are received through a channel wrapped in [RespNoti](crate::server::RespNoti).
//!
//! ## Protocol
//!
//! The details are described in [crate::proto].
//!
//! The packet starts with a fixed-length header and is followed by a variable-length body.
//! An [RpcAction](crate::proto::RpcAction) represents the type of packet.
//! The action type is either numeric or a string.
//!
//! The request body contains a mandatory structured message and optional blob data.
//!
//! The response for each request either returns successfully with an optional structured message and
//! optional blob data (the response can be empty), or it returns with an RpcError. The error type can
//! be numeric (like a Unix errno), text (for user-customized errors), or a statically predefined error
//! string (for errors that occur during socket communication or encoding/decoding)
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! You can refer to the test case for example:
//!
//! - client: <https://github.com/NaturalIO/occams-rpc/blob/master/stream/test/src/client.rs>
//! - server: <https://github.com/NaturalIO/occams-rpc/blob/master/stream/test/src/server.rs>
//! - task handling: <https://github.com/NaturalIO/occams-rpc/blob/master/stream/test/src/tests/test_normal.rs>
